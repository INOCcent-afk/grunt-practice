        <p>If there is magic on this planet,
it is contained in water.</p>
        <p>Aquarium Zen is a natural aquarium store filled with vibrant aquatic plants, a unique selection of healthy tropical fish, quality supplies and the inspiration to get you excited about keeping aquariums again.  </p>
        <p>At its heart, Aquarium Zen is an independent, small business, tropical fish store and we can serve the basic needs of most freshwater aquarium owners, even if the Nature Aquarium is not your style.  Our goal is to mentor our clients in creating the aquarium of their dreams.</p>
        <p>We invite you to visit our beautiful showroom and Nature Aquarium gallery, now open to the public.  Of course, you can also connect with us on Facebook:</p>

    <h1>TROPICAL FISH</h1>

<div class="all-text-showcase">
    <div class="all-text-showcase-title">
        <h3>Aquarium Zen's selection of tropical fish is varied and unique, focused on species that do well in freshwater planted aquariums.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="all-text-showcase-p">
        <p>Our interest is in small, peaceful species that will grace the aquarium with gentle, colorful energy.  Most of the fish in our store have been selected so that they can be freely combined in planted community aquariums.  The owner of Aquarium Zen, Steve Waldron, has over 30 years of aquarium experience and can tell you everything you need to know about the fish of your interest.</p>
        <p>We source many of our fish from local sources and even breed some of our own such as rare varieties of livebearers and dwarf shrimp.  We can also special order just about any type of freshwater fish and have the connections to track down rare species.</p>

        <h3>Aquatic plants provide the structure and biological support to keep our aquarium ecosystems thriving.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="all-text-showcase-p">
        <p>Aquarium plants are diverse and beautiful in their own right and we see our Nature Aquariums as a style of underwater gardening.  There are aquatic plants for every type of aquarium and we specialize in helping our customers discover the right plant for their aquarium conditions and experience level.</p>
        <p>Every aquarium benefits from the addition of living plants and your fish will feel more at ease, healthy and contented in a planted aquarium.  Even if you don't have a green thumb, we can find the right plant for you and your aquarium.</p>
        <p>Aquarium Zen carries a wide selection of nursery grown plants and also a diverse collection of rarities that we cultivate in the store.</p>
